# **_The "Rock - Paper - Scissors" Game_**
### This repository contains a console based on Python implementation of the "Rock, scissors and paper" game
## The rules are as follows:
#### - Rock beats scissors (the scissors get broken by the rock)
#### - Scissors beats paper (the paper gets cut by the scissors)
#### - Paper beats rock (the paper covers the rock)
#### - If both player's choices are equal, the result is draw
#### *The player choses "r" for rock, "p" for paper or "s" for scissor and the computer chooses a random option, then announces who the winner is* 
## Features:
#### - Ability to choose to continue playing or not 
#### - Giving the player a bigger chance to win versus the machine (if a user loses two times, the third one is a win)
#### - Multicolored text
#### - If a player makes a choice to stop playing, the wins, loses and draws counters are being displayed
